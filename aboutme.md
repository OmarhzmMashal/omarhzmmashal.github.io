### About me
PhD Student (2025-) in Quantum Optics at Purdue (ECE Department).
Intuition-driven autodidact aiming to ask the right questions, I am interested in the history of science, specifically in how past scientific questions are reformulated into the questions we ask today. I work with Hadiseh Alaeian and Valentin Walther, focusing on exciton dynamics in semiconductors under strong electromagnetic fields; We are investigating the applicability of Floquet theory in many-body open quantum systems and its limitations.
