### About me

PhD Student (2025â€“) in Quantum Optics at Purdue (ECE Department). Intuition-driven autodidact aiming to ask the right questions, I am interested in the history of science, specifically in how past scientific questions are reformulated into the questions we ask today.

I work with Hadiseh Alaeian and Valentin Walther, focusing on exciton dynamics in semiconductors under strong electromagnetic fields; Modleing the nonlinear optical response via dipolar interaction under strong microwave field.

Current Interest: The limitations of Floquet theory in many-body quantum open quantum systems.
