<p>My name is <strong>Omar H. Mashaal</strong>, I am a PhD Student (2025â€“) in <strong>Theoretical Quantum Optics at Purdue University</strong>. Intuition-driven autodidact aiming to ask the right questions, I am interested in the history of science, specifically in how past scientific questions are reformulated into the questions we ask today.</p>

<p>I work with Hadiseh Alaeian and Valentin Walther, focusing on exciton dynamics in a semiconductor (cuprous oxide); modeling the nonlinear optical response arising from dipole-dipole interactions under strong microwave field.</p>

<p><strong>Current Interest: The limitations of Floquet theory in many-body open quantum systems.</strong></p>
