## About me

PhD Student (2025â€“) in Theoretical Quantum Optics at Purdue University. Intuition-driven autodidact aiming to ask the right questions, I am interested in the history of science, specifically in how past scientific questions are reformulated into the questions we ask today.

I work with Hadiseh Alaeian and Valentin Walther, focusing on exciton dynamics in a semiconductor (cuprous oxide); modeling the nonlinear optical response arising from dipole-dipole interactions under strong microwave field.

Current Interest: The limitations of Floquet theory in many-body open quantum systems.
