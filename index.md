## About me

PhD Student (2025â€“) in Quantum Optics at Purdue (ECE Department). Intuition-driven autodidact aiming to ask the right questions, I am interested in the history of science, specifically in how past scientific questions are reformulated into the questions we ask today.

I work with Hadiseh Alaeian and Valentin Walther, focusing on excitons dynamics in a semiconductor (Cuprous oxide) under strong electromagnetic fields; Modeling the nonlinear optical response via dipolar interaction under strong microwave field.

Current Interest: The limitations of Floquet theory in many-body quantum open quantum systems.
