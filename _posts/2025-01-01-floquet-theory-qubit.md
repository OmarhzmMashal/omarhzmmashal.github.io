We will solve a strongly driven two-level system (qubit), where the rotating wave approximation (RWA) no longer holds.  

{: .box-note}
We investigate the problem of a general linear system of ordinary differential equations  
$$\frac{d}{dt} \mathbf{X}(t) = \mathbf{\hat{M}}(t) \mathbf{X}(t), \quad {\mathbf{X}}(0) = \mathbf{X}_0$$  
where $$\mathbf{X}(t)$$ is a vector of time dependent variables $$x_i(t)$$, $\mathbf{\hat{M}}(t)$ is a time-dependent linear operator, and $$\mathbf{X}_0$$ is a given initial condition.
